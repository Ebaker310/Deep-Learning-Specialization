Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

Learning Objectives:
- Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
- Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
- Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
- Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
- Build Python and Numpy skills
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
