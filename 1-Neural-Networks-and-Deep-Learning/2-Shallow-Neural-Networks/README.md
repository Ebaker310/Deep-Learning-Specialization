Shallow Neural Networks
---
Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

Learning Objectives:

- Describe hidden units and hidden layers
- Apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network.
- Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer
- Apply random initialization to your neural network
- Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
- Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer
